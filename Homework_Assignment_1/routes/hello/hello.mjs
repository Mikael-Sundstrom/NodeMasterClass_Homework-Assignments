When I started programming, I targeted myself at C#, mainly because it was a new language and because the syntax was so beautiful. But over time, I discovered node and npm. I found it easier to work with. However, with this course I get more control over what it is you do with node, and what it really is, which is amazing! I'm thrilled.",
